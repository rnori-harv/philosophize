        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The father of Mohism, Mozi was influential for outlining how political discourse should work. Incredibly pragmatic, Mozi invented consequentialism in ancient China and often developed technical solutions for problems found in ancient Chinese society.

        <h2>Mozi's Genres</h2>
        <p>
        Genres that resemble Mohism are ones that are technical and precise. In music, I think this would translate to the ones that rely the most on rhythm. Some examples are EDM, House, and Trap.
