        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Kongzi, also known as Confucious, was primarily concerned with the mastery of the Way (or Dao) through strict ritualistic practices, filial piety, cultivation of the arts, and a gentleman demeanor. Kongzi sought to create rules and methods that humans could use to strive to become worthy gentlemen of society.

        <h2>Kongzi's Genres</h2>
        <p>
        Some genres that would resemble Kongziâ€™s ideology are classical, opera, and jazz. These categories are refined and heavily structured, which mirrors Confucian ideology. People who love classical, opera, and jazz tend to see beauty in structure in a similar manner to how Confucians worship the rituals needed to become a gentleman. 
        Pop also falls into Kongzi's realm as it is the most popular genre, and Confucian thought was historically the most popular.
