        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Zhuangzi in many ways is the opposite of Kongzi in terms of his philosophical perspectives. Zhuangzi does not seek to understand the world but rather live in harmony with it in his version of the Dao. In other words, Zhuangzi embraces the chaos and treats it as a natural and essential element of the world we live in. This philosophy is definitely the most free-flowing and creative as it appeases the human soul rather than mind
        </p>
        <h2>Zhuangzi's Genres</h2>
        <p>
        This philosophy embraces the most creative and artistically ambitious genres in music today that focus on stimulating the soul. Some genres that fall into this category are alternative rock, Indie R&B, and country.
